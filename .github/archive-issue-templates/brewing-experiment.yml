      placeholder: |
        Based on research showing [finding], we hypothesize that [specific prediction].
        
        Example: Based on research showing pH affects yeast ester production,
        we hypothesize that mashing at pH 5.2 vs 5.5 will produce 
        noticeably different ester profiles in the final beer.
