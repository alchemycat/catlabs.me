# catlabs.me

Welcome to catlabs.me - A comprehensive platform for deep brewing research and development.

## Overview

This repository represents catlabs.me and hosts the brewing research platform at brews.catlabs.me. We use GitHub Flow methodology to manage deep research, recipe development, and brewing experimentation with a focus on data-driven brewing innovation.

## Core Workflow

Our brewing research follows a systematic approach using GitHub Flow:

### 🔬 Research Pipeline
```
Research Request (Issue) → Deep Research (Branch) → Recipe Development (PR) → 
Experiments (Issue) → Results Analysis (PR) → Knowledge Base (Update)
```

### Key Components

1. **Deep Research System**
   - Structured research prompts for consistency
   - Comprehensive documentation requirements
   - Multi-source investigation methodology
   - Practical brewing applications focus

2. **Recipe Development**
   - Research-driven formulation
   - Staged development (experimental → tested → production)
   - Complete documentation and rationale
   - Version control and iteration tracking

3. **Experiment Design**
   - Hypothesis-driven testing
   - Controlled variable methodology
   - Statistical analysis planning
   - Reproducible procedures

4. **Knowledge Management**
   - Organized knowledge base
   - Cross-referenced documentation
   - Continuous updates from experiments
   - Best practices compilation

## Getting Started

### For Researchers

1. **Start a Research Project**
   - Create issue using `🔬 Deep Research Request` template
   - Define clear objectives and scope
   - Use research prompt templates for guidance
   - Document findings systematically

2. **Access Research Prompts**
   - Browse `brews/000-research-prompts/`
   - Select appropriate template
   - Follow structured approach
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage

### For Recipe Developers

1. **Create Research-Based Recipes**
   - Start with research findings
   - Use `🍺 Recipe Development` issue template
   - Apply scientific principles
   - Document all decisions

2. **Recipe Stages**
   - Experimental: Initial concepts
   - Tested: Validated through brewing
   - Production: Refined and consistent

### For Experimenters

1. **Design Experiments**
   - Use `🧪 Brewing Experiment` template
   - Link to research and recipes
   - Plan data collection
   - Define success criteria

2. **Document Results**
   - Use `📊 Experiment Results` template
   - Include all data
   - Provide statistical analysis
   - Draw actionable conclusions

## GitHub Flow Integration

### Issue Templates
- `🔬 Deep Research Request` - Start research projects
- `📋 Research Prompt Template` - Guide research execution  
- `🍺 Recipe Development` - Create recipes from research
- `🧪 Brewing Experiment` - Design validation experiments
- `📊 Experiment Results` - Document and analyze results

### Automation
- Automatic branch creation for research
- Document structure validation
- Progress tracking
- Deliverable verification

## Using the Obsidian Vault

The `brews/` directory is configured as an Obsidian vault:

1. **Open in Obsidian**
   - Open Obsidian
   - Select "Open folder as vault"
   - Choose the `brews/` directory

2. **Navigation**
   - Use graph view to see connections
   - Follow links between research and recipes
   - Use tags for categorization
   - Search across all content

3. **Best Practices**
   - Link related documents
   - Use consistent tags
   - Include metadata
   - Regular reviews and updates

## Quality Standards

- **Research**: Minimum 10 authoritative sources
- **Recipes**: Complete specifications and documentation
- **Experiments**: Statistical validity and reproducibility
- **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive, and actionable
