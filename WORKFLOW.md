# Brewing Research & Recipe Development Workflow

This repository follows a GitHub Flow pattern for brewing research and recipe development, using issues and pull requests to manage the brewing process from research to final recipe.

## GitHub Flow for Brewing

### 1. Research Phase (Issues)

**Create Research Issue** using `üç∫ Recipe Research` template:
- Identify brewing topic or recipe optimization need
- Define research objectives and scope
- Assign priority and timeline
- Use labels: `research`, `brewing`, `recipe-optimization`

**Research Branch Workflow:**
```bash
git checkout -b research/topic-name
# Create research document in research/
# Document findings and insights
# Create PR to merge research
```

### 2. Recipe Development (Issues ‚Üí PRs)

**Create New Recipe Issue** using `‚ûï New Recipe` template:
- Define recipe concept and inspiration
- Set target specifications (ABV, IBU, style)
- Plan ingredient selection
- Use labels: `enhancement`, `new-recipe`, `brewing`

**Recipe Development Workflow:**
```bash
git checkout -b recipe/recipe-name
# Create recipe file using template
# Implement research findings
# Calculate specifications
# Create PR for recipe addition
```

### 3. Brew Planning (Issues)

**Create Brew Day Issue** using `üçª Brew Day Planning` template:
- Select recipe to brew
- Plan brewing timeline
- Organize ingredients and equipment
- Set up measurement tracking
- Use labels: `brew-day`, `planning`, `brewing`

### 4. Brewing Execution (Branches)

**Brewing Session Workflow:**
```bash
git checkout -b brewing/recipe-batch-id
# Create brewing log from template
# Document actual brewing process
# Record all measurements and observations
# Create PR to add brewing log
```

## Issue Labels

| Label | Purpose | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `research` | Deep research topics | Background investigation |
| `new-recipe` | Recipe creation | Adding new recipes |
| `recipe-optimization` | Recipe improvements | Refining existing recipes |
| `brew-day` | Brewing sessions | Planning and executing brews |
| `planning` | Organizational tasks | Scheduling and preparation |
| `brewing` | General brewing activity | All brewing-related work |
| `enhancement` | Improvements | General improvements |
| `documentation` | Documentation updates | README, guides, etc. |
| `collaboration` | Multi-person projects | Mae-on, Brewtung, etc. |

## Branch Naming Conventions

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Research | `research/topic-name` | `research/belgian-yeast-strains` |
| Recipe | `recipe/recipe-name` | `recipe/belgian-golden-strong` |
| Brewing | `brewing/recipe-batch` | `brewing/bgs-001` |
| Documentation | `docs/topic` | `docs/water-chemistry-guide` |
| Feature | `feature/feature-name` | `feature/recipe-calculator` |

## File Naming Conventions

### Recipes
- Format: `r###-recipe-name.md`
- Example: `r001-belgian-golden-strong-ale.md`
- Sequential numbering for tracking

### Research
- Format: `res-###-topic-name.md`  
- Example: `res-001-belgian-yeast-comparison.md`
- Links to related recipes

### Brewing Logs
- Format: `[recipe-id]-batch-###-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Example: `r001-batch-001-2024-03-15.md`
- Tracks multiple batches per recipe

## Pull Request Process

### Recipe PRs
1. **Research First**: Ensure adequate research exists
2. **Template Compliance**: Use recipe template
3. **Calculations**: Verify all brewing calculations
4. **Review**: Get review from brewing partners
5. **Integration**: Update recipe index and cross-references

### Research PRs  
1. **Comprehensive**: Address all research objectives
2. **Sources**: Include proper citations and references
3. **Actionable**: Provide clear implementation guidance
4. **Linked**: Connect to related recipe development

### Brewing Log PRs
1. **Complete Data**: Include all measurements and observations
2. **Analysis**: Provide post-brew assessment
3. **Improvements**: Document lessons learned
4. **Updates**: Update recipe file with actual data

## Collaboration Integration

### Mae-on Project
- Use `collaboration` label
- Reference in recipe and research files
- Coordinate via issues for planning

### Brewtung Collaboration
- Use `collaboration` label  
- Document shared brewing sessions
- Track joint recipe development

### Catalyst Brewing
- Use `collaboration` label
- Professional brewing integration
- Advanced technique documentation

## Quality Control

### Recipe Reviews

## Integration with Obsidian

The `brews/` directory serves as an Obsidian vault for:
- Quick notes and brainstorming
- Linking concepts across recipes
- Visual recipe development
- Research organization
- Brewing session planning

**Sync Process:**
1. Use Obsidian for rapid note-taking and ideation
2. Formalize research and recipes in main repository
3. Create issues/PRs for structured development
4. Reference Obsidian notes in GitHub discussions

## Automation Opportunities

### GitHub Actions (Future)
- Recipe calculation validation
- Style guideline compliance checking
- Brewing calendar integration
- Automatic cross-reference updates
- Template compliance verification

### Integration Options
- BeerXML export from recipes
- Brewing software data import
- Calendar integration for brew planning
- Inventory management links
