# Brewing Logs

Documentation of actual brewing sessions, measurements, and results.

## Brewing Log Index

| Batch ID | Recipe | Date | Brewer(s) | Status | OG | FG | ABV | Rating |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|--------|----|----|-----|--------|
| R001-B001 | [Example Recipe] | 2024-XX-XX | [Name] | Complete | 1.XXX | 1.XXX | X.X% | X/10 |

## Log Organization

### File Naming Convention
- Format: `[recipe-id]-batch-[###]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Example: `r001-batch-001-2024-03-15.md`
- Sequential batch numbering per recipe
