# Research Prompt Templates

This directory contains structured prompts for conducting deep brewing research. These templates ensure consistent, thorough investigation of brewing topics.

## Available Templates

### 1. [Style Analysis](./style-analysis.md)
For comprehensive research into beer styles, including:
- Historical origins and evolution
- Technical specifications
- Traditional ingredients and methods
- Modern interpretations
- Commercial examples analysis

### 2. [Ingredient Research](./ingredient-research.md)
For deep investigation of brewing ingredients:
- Malts, hops, yeast, water, adjuncts
- Chemical composition and properties
- Sensory contributions
- Usage guidelines
- Quality evaluation

### 3. [Technique Optimization](./technique-optimization.md)
For process and technique research:
- Scientific principles
- Traditional vs. modern methods
- Efficiency improvements
- Equipment considerations
- Troubleshooting frameworks

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Select Appropriate Template**
   - Choose based on research topic
   - Can combine multiple templates for complex topics

2. **Create Research Issue**
   - Use GitHub issue template "Deep Research Request"
   - Reference the prompt template you'll use
   - Define specific objectives

3. **Follow Template Structure**
   - Work through each section systematically
   - Don't skip sections - note if not applicable
   - Add additional sections as needed

4. **Document Findings**
   - Create research document in `001-research-outputs/`
   - Follow the output format specified in template
   - Link all sources and references

5. **Generate Deliverables**
   - Create experimental recipes
   - Design validation experiments  
   - Update knowledge base
   - Propose follow-up research

## Research Quality Standards

### Minimum Requirements
- **Sources**: At least 10 authoritative references
- **Analysis**: Both qualitative and quantitative data
- **Practical Application**: Clear brewing applications
- **Documentation**: Complete and well-organized
- **Actionable Output**: Specific recommendations

### Best Practices
- Start broad, then narrow focus
- Validate theoretical findings with practical examples
- Include both historical and modern perspectives
- Consider multiple scales (homebrew to commercial)
- Document what you don't know as well as what you do

## Creating New Templates

If you need a research template for a topic not covered:

1. Follow the existing template structure
2. Include all standard sections:
   - Purpose
   - Research prompt structure
   - Research methodology
   - Output format
   - Quality criteria
3. Submit PR with new template
4. Update this README

## Integration with GitHub Flow

1. **Issue Creation**: Research request issue
2. **Branch**: `research/[topic-name]`
3. **Research Phase**: Use templates, document findings
4. **Pull Request**: Review and merge research
5. **Follow-up**: Create recipe and experiment issues

## Tips for Effective Research

- **Time-box sections**: Don't get stuck in endless research
- **Document as you go**: Don't wait until the end
- **Cite everything**: Better to over-cite than under-cite
- **Think practically**: Always consider brewing applications
- **Collaborate**: Tag others for specialized knowledge
- **Iterate**: Research can be updated and improved
