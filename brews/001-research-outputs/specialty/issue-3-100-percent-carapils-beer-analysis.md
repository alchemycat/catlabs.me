# 100% Carapils Beer Brewing Analysis

**Issue:** [#3 - 100% carapils beer](https://github.com/alchemycat/catlabs.me/issues/3)  
**Research Date:** June 11, 2025  
**Researcher:** Claude AI  
**Research Type:** Deep Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary

Brewing with 100% Carapils malt is technically achievable but presents extraordinary challenges due to the malt's complete lack of diastatic power and predominantly unfermentable dextrin composition. Success requires comprehensive external enzyme supplementation, specialized mashing protocols, and acceptance of significantly altered beer characteristics.

### Critical Discoveries

- **Diastatic Power:** Carapils exhibits 0° Lintner diastatic power (Briess) requiring complete external enzyme addition
- **Maximum OG:** 1.020-1.035 (vs. 1.045-1.055 for base malts)
- **Expected Attenuation:** 30-50% (vs. 75-85% standard)
- **Fermentable Extract Ratio:** 40-60% with remaining 40-60% as unfermentable dextrins
- **Commercial Viability:** Not recommended due to 2-3x higher costs and limited market appeal

### Key Requirements

- External α-amylase and glucoamylase enzymes essential
- Modified step mash protocol with extended rest times
- Aggressive hop additions (40-60 IBU) to balance residual sweetness
- Specialized yeast strains with high dextrin tolerance

## Detailed Enzyme Protocol with Calculations

### Required Enzyme Specifications

- **Style classification:** "Specialty Experimental Beer"
- **Key selling points:** Unique body, session strength, brewing innovation
- **Challenges:** Consumer education, style expectations

### Production Recommendations
- **Start small:** 1-bbl pilot batches
- **Blend strategy:** Use as component (25-50%) in specialty beers
- **Alternative application:** Low/no-alcohol beer base
- **Quality focus:** Position as ultra-premium experimental product

## Conclusion

While brewing with 100% Carapils malt is technically feasible through comprehensive enzyme supplementation and specialized protocols, it represents an extreme brewing challenge with limited commercial viability. The resulting beer exhibits unique characteristics—extremely full body, low alcohol content, and significant residual sweetness—that deviate substantially from traditional beer expectations.

### Primary Recommendations

1. **For experimentation:** Follow the detailed protocol with careful attention to enzyme additions and pH management
2. **For commercial application:** Limit Carapils to 20-40% of grain bill for specialty beers
3. **For innovation:** Explore high-percentage Carapils (50-75%) in low-alcohol or therapeutic beverages
4. **For traditional brewing:** Maintain Carapils usage at 5-10% for body and foam enhancement

The 100% Carapils brewing process pushes the boundaries of brewing science and requires acceptance of fundamentally altered beer characteristics. Success depends on managing expectations, precise technical execution, and positioning the final product appropriately within the craft beer market's experimental segment.
