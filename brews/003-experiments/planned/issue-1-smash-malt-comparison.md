# SMaSH Pale Malt Comparison Experiment - Issue #1

**Experiment ID**: EXP-2024-001
**Issue Reference**: #1
**Research Basis**: brews/001-research-outputs/ingredients/issue-1-pale-malt-comparison-bb-weyermann.md
**Status**: Planned

## Hypothesis

Based on research showing Barrett Burston Extra Pale has lower color (3.3 EBC max) and higher enzyme content compared to Weyermann Pale Ale (5.5-7.5 EBC), we hypothesize that:

1. BB Extra Pale will produce a lighter colored beer (1-2 SRM difference)
2. BB Extra Pale will achieve 2-3% higher extract efficiency
3. Weyermann will provide more complex malt flavor detectable in triangle testing
4. BB Extra Pale will result in higher attenuation (2-3 points lower FG)

## Experimental Design

### Variables
**Independent Variable**: Base Malt Type (BB Extra Pale vs Weyermann Pale Ale)

**Dependent Variables**:
- Extract Efficiency (%)
- Original/Final Gravity
- Color (SRM)
- pH measurements
- Sensory characteristics

**Controlled Variables**:
- Water profile: 100ppm Ca, 50:50 SO4:Cl
- Mash: 65°C for 60 minutes
- Hops: Cascade, 30 IBU total
- Yeast: US-05, 18°C fermentation

### Methodology
- Parallel brewing on same day
- Identical equipment and procedures
- Comprehensive data logging
- Triangle test evaluation after 4 weeks

## Data Collection Plan
- [x] Mash pH and efficiency measurements
- [x] Gravity readings throughout fermentation
- [x] Color and clarity assessment
- [x] Sensory evaluation protocols
- [x] Statistical analysis framework

## Success Criteria
- Statistically significant differences detected
- Clean fermentation profiles achieved
- Comprehensive data set collected
- Actionable conclusions reached
