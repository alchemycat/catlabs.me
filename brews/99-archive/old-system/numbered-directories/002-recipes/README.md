# Recipe Development

Research-driven recipe development with systematic progression from experimental to production.

## Recipe Development Stages

### 1. Experimental Recipes
- Initial formulations based on research
- May have wide parameter ranges
- Focus on testing concepts
- Expected to need refinement

### 2. Tested Recipes  
- Brewed at least once
- Basic parameters validated
- Feedback incorporated
- Ready for optimization

### 3. Production Recipes
- Consistently successful
- Optimized parameters
- Complete documentation
- Ready for regular brewing

## Recipe Document Structure

Every recipe must include:

1. **Header Information**
   - Recipe name and ID
   - Version number
   - Development stage
   - Research source

2. **Target Specifications**
   - Style category
   - Vital statistics (OG, FG, ABV, IBU, SRM)
   - Batch size
   - Efficiency assumptions

3. **Ingredients**
   - Grain bill with percentages
   - Hop schedule with timing
   - Yeast selection and pitch rate
   - Water chemistry targets
   - Research rationale for each

4. **Process Parameters**
   - Mash schedule
   - Boil duration
   - Fermentation plan
   - Research-based decisions

5. **Development Notes**
   - Changes from previous versions
   - Test batch results
   - Optimization opportunities

## File Naming Convention

Format: `[stage]-[style]-[name]-v[X.X].md`

Examples:
- `exp-belgian-wit-citrus-v1.0.md`
- `test-ipa-tropical-research-v2.1.md`  
- `prod-stout-chocolate-coffee-v3.0.md`

## Version Control

- **v1.x** - Experimental stage
- **v2.x** - Tested stage
- **v3.x** - Production stage
- Minor versions (x.1, x.2) for iterations

## Research Integration

Every recipe must reference:
- Source research document(s)
- Specific findings applied
- Rationale for deviations
- Validation experiments planned

## Quality Standards

### Experimental Recipes
- Clear hypothesis from research
- Defined success criteria
- Complete calculations
- Safety considerations

### Tested Recipes
- Actual brew data included
- Sensory evaluation notes
- Identified improvements
- Cost analysis

### Production Recipes
- Consistent results (3+ batches)
- Optimized efficiency
- Scaling guidelines
- Troubleshooting guide

## Recipe Progression

```
Research Finding → Experimental Recipe (v1.0) → Test Brew → 
Feedback → Tested Recipe (v2.0) → Multiple Brews → 
Optimization → Production Recipe (v3.0)
```

## Cross-References

Link recipes to:
- Research documents that informed them
- Experiments that validated them
- Brewing logs from test batches
- Knowledge base entries
