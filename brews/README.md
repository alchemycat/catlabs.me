# 🍺 Simple Brewing Vault

This is the catlabs.me brewing vault - organized for humans who brew.

## Structure

```
brews/
├── 01-research/    # What I learned
├── 02-recipes/     # What I'm making
├── 03-notes/       # How it went
├── 04-templates/   # Simple templates
└── 99-archive/     # Old stuff
```

## How to Use

1. **Have an idea?** → Create issue or add to 01-research/
2. **Making a recipe?** → Add to 02-recipes/
3. **Brewed something?** → Add notes to 03-notes/

That's it. No complex categories. No numbered phases. Just brew.
