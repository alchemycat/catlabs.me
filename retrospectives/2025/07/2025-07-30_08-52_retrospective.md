**Duration**: ~82 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Workflow simplification and recipe extraction

## Session Summary
Major workflow simplification by removing redundant `ccc` command and streamlining the brewing project workflow. Extracted multiple German Blonde Ale recipes and created comprehensive documentation templates.

## Timeline
- 14:30 - Started with extracting images from issues #18 and #17
- 14:45 - Created bilingual beer recipe template
- 15:00 - Analyzed workflow and identified `ccc` redundancy
- 15:15 - Simplified CLAUDE.md to remove `ccc` command
- 15:30 - Processed issues #23 and #26 (more German Blonde Ale recipes)
- 15:52 - Created retrospective

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
CLAUDE.md (major refactor)
brews/04-templates/beer-recipe-template.md (created)
brews/02-recipes/issue-23-german-blonde-ale-v2.md (created)
Multiple image extracts in brews/05-images/
```

### Key Code Changes
- Removed `ccc` command from workflow (brewing issues ARE the context)
- Simplified flow to: Issue → `nnn` → `gogogo` → PR
- Updated `nnn` to auto-extract images when needed
- Created bilingual recipe template with clean format
- Documented multiple German Blonde Ale recipes

### Architecture Decisions
- Decision 1: Remove `ccc` - brewing projects don't need complex state management
- Decision 2: Make `nnn` the primary planning command with auto-extraction
- Decision 3: Keep `qqq` for manual image extraction when needed

## AI Diary
Started session extracting recipe images, which led to a deeper analysis of the workflow. Realized the `ccc` command was adding unnecessary complexity for a brewing project where each issue is self-contained. The breakthrough came when recognizing that brewing issues already contain their full context - there's no need for separate context issues.

The workflow simplification from 4 commands to 3 (with `qqq` being mostly automatic) significantly reduces cognitive load. Also discovered we had the same German Blonde Ale recipe submitted three times (#18, #23, #26), which suggests users are testing the system.

## What Went Well
- Successfully identified and removed workflow redundancy
- Created clear, bilingual recipe template
- Maintained backward compatibility (kept `qqq` for manual use)
- Clear documentation updates
- Efficient image extraction process

## What Could Improve
- Need to handle duplicate recipes better
- Consider creating a master recipe file for variations
- Could automate `rrr` command like we did with `qqq`
- Direct commits to main (should have used PR for CLAUDE.md changes)

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Accidentally committed to main instead of using PR
  **Resolution**: Updated CLAUDE.md to emphasize GitHub flow even more

## Honest Feedback
The original workflow was over-engineered for a brewing project. Good example of how copying patterns from complex software projects doesn't always make sense for simpler domains. The simplified workflow is much more intuitive and matches how people actually think about brewing tasks.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Context should match the domain - brewing is simpler than coding
- **Mistake**: Direct commits to main - even when improving the workflow docs
- **Discovery**: Users appreciate simplicity - less commands = better UX

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement the German Blonde Ale v3 recipe (issue #27)
- [ ] Consider creating a "master recipes" section for common brews
- [ ] Maybe create actual shell scripts for `nnn` and `rrr`
- [ ] Add duplicate detection to prevent same recipe multiple times
